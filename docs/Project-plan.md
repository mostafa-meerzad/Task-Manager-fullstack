# Project Plan: Task Manager Fullstack

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for developing the Task Manager Fullstack application, a simple yet powerful tool for managing daily tasks with features such as CRUD operations, user authentication, and a responsive UI.

---

## Objectives
- Provide a secure platform for users to manage personal tasks.
- Ensure seamless integration between frontend and backend.
- Deliver a polished, user-friendly interface.

---

## Phases and Tasks

### Phase 1: Setup and Initial Configuration
- [x] Create a GitHub repository with the necessary setup.
- [x] Add `.gitignore` for Node.js and create a `README.md`.
- [x] Choose the MIT license for the project.
- [ ] Set up the backend directory structure.
- [ ] Set up the frontend directory structure.

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- [ ] Initialize a Node.js project in the `backend` directory.
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies (Express, Mongoose, dotenv, etc.).
- [ ] Set up a MongoDB database connection.
- [ ] Create API endpoints for task CRUD operations:
  - [ ] Add Task
  - [ ] Get Tasks
  - [ ] Update Task
  - [ ] Delete Task
- [ ] Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT.
- [ ] Add validation for API requests (e.g., using Joi or a similar library).

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [ ] Initialize a React project in the `frontend` directory.
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies (React Router, Axios, etc.).
- [ ] Create the following components:
  - [ ] Task List
  - [ ] Add/Edit Task Form
  - [ ] User Authentication Forms (Login/Signup)
- [ ] Implement state management for tasks and user authentication.
- [ ] Connect the frontend to the backend API.

### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for backend routes and services.
- [ ] Write integration tests for backend API.
- [ ] Test the frontend UI for usability and responsiveness.
- [ ] Perform manual testing to ensure the application works end-to-end.

### Phase 5: Deployment
- [ ] Set up the backend for production (e.g., configure environment variables, use a process manager like PM2).
- [ ] Build the frontend for production.
- [ ] Deploy the application (e.g., use platforms like Vercel for frontend and Render for backend).

| Phase              | Start Date | End Date   |
|--------------------|------------|------------|
| Setup              | 2024-12-07 | 2024-12-08 |
| Backend Development| 2024-12-09 | 2024-12-15 |
| Frontend Development| 2024-12-16 | 2024-12-22 |
| Testing            | 2024-12-23 | 2024-12-26 |
| Deployment         | 2024-12-27 | 2024-12-28 |

## Deliverables
- Fully functional task management application.
- Clean and maintainable codebase.
- Deployment-ready project with documentation.

---

## Risks and Challenges
- **Database Configuration**: Ensure MongoDB is correctly set up locally and/or in production.
- **Authentication Security**: Handle JWT securely and avoid common vulnerabilities.
- **Frontend Integration**: Ensure smooth communication between frontend and backend.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: React, Axios, React Router
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Render, or equivalent platforms

---

## Notes
- This plan is iterative and may evolve based on project requirements.
- Regularly review progress to ensure alignment with objectives.
